📋 Task Management App – React Project

🌟 Overview :
This is a simple and responsive Task Management App built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
It was created as part of my learning journey at Error Makes Clever (EMC), under the teaching of Agnel John (Founder of EMC), with guidance from Nandhini (Co-Mentor).

🚀 Features :
📝 Create Task
✏️ Edit Task
❌ Delete Task
🔍 Search Tasks
📄 Task Table View
📱 Fully Responsive UI
🔄 React Router Navigation

💻 Tech Stack :
~ React (Vite)
~ Tailwind CSS
~ React Router
~ JavaScript (ES6+)

📂 Pages :
~ /home – View, search, edit, delete tasks
~ /task – Create or update a task

🧠 How It Works :
~ Uses useState for storing tasks
~ Search filters tasks by Title
~ Edit fills the form with existing task
~ Routing handled with React Router v6
